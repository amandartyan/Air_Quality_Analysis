# India's Air Quality Analysis

Background Project : India's Air Quality Analysis is a dataset about Air Quality Index of city in India and the elements that can be affects the air quality.

Objective : To know how to minimize the air - pollution in India : Analysis features for gain more information & optimize metric ML to predicting data

Features : 
- Elements :
  - PM 2.5
  - PM 10
  - NO
  - NO2
  - NOx
  - NH3
  - CO
  - SO2
  - O3
  - Benzene
  - Toluene
  - Xylene
- City : 26 cities in India

Target : Air Quality Index (AQI)


Conclusion (Result) : The best model is Random forest (classification) to find out how much the elements and location of the city influence of Air Quality's Index. Besides that based on K-Means clustering, there are four cluster among the dataset based on AQI, and sample of elements.

Recommendation :
- The government can allocate a certain amount of funds to develop environmentally friendly fuels
- Use Machine Learning Model to predict expected outcomes of Air Quality Index
- Focusing efforts to control air pollution from "The Big 4" by control population in those cities.
